# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

--A login page has been created with the help of react which takes in email and password. 

--After login is successfully after validation, four pages using react components and react-router (Home, About, Jobs, Contact) can be accessed. 

--Nav bar with React Card componenets have been used in these four pages. This card takes in title and description and it changes with each page. 

--The "map" function has been used in About.js file. The map() function is used to iterate over an array and manipulate or change data items.
--In React, the map() function is most commonly used for rendering a list of data to the DOM. Here, we have used it for email.

--In About.js axios.get have been used to link the frontend to backend.

--In the backend we use the mongodb for database(atlas), cors, express and bcrypt.

--The schema is used in User.js.

--The handler functions loginHandler, createUserHandler, updateHandler, deleteHandler and getAllUsers have been used for API calls(post, put, delete, getAll) in handlers.js.
